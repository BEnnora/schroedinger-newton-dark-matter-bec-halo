# Numerical Solution of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton Equation for BEC-CDM Halos

This repository contains a Python-based numerical simulation of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation, modeling the dispersion of wave functions in a self-gravitating Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensate (BEC) dark matter halo. The simulation applies the Thomas algorithm to solve the resulting tridiagonal system efficiently.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Investigate the dynamics of a BEC-CDM halo by solving the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation numerically.
- **Methodology**: Finite difference discretization combined with the Thomas algorithm to solve the tridiagonal matrix system.
- **Outcome**: Due to computational limitations, the simulation does not yield observable dispersion. Instead, it explores numerical behavior under coarse discretization and discusses why the key observables \( r_{99} \) remains unchanged.
