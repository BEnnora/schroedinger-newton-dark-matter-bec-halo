# Schrödinger–Newton Equation Simulation for BEC-CDM Halos

This repository contains a Python-based numerical simulation of the Schrödinger–Newton equation, modeling the dispersion of wave functions in a self-gravitating Bose–Einstein Condensate (BEC) dark matter halo. The simulation applies the Thomas algorithm to solve the resulting tridiagonal system efficiently.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Investigate the dynamics of a BEC-CDM halo by solving the Schrödinger–Newton equation numerically.
- **Methodology**: Finite difference discretization combined with the Thomas algorithm to solve the tridiagonal matrix system.
- **Outcome**: Visualize and analyze the dispersion behavior of wave functions under self-gravity, in the context of galactic dark matter halos.
